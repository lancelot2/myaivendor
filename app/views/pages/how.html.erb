<div class="container how-it-works">

<p>The concept of lightweight chat-based interfaces for commerce was pioneered and popularized in Asia by apps like China’s WeChat and Japan’s Line. Rather than forcing people to download entire apps for each business or use case, they can simply send messages “official accounts” or chat bots inside the instant messaging app they already use all day. These allow you to make purchases with a WeChat-connected payment option, order a taxi, buy movie tickets, pay bills, and more.</p>

<p>These bots and official accounts make accessing added utility not only convenient for the user. Chat app platforms relieve businesses from having to build, popularize, and maintain whole mobile apps for multiple phone operating systems. With so many apps flooding the app stores, getting people to discover them and go through the hassle of installing an app can be tough for businesses. It’s much more casual and less daunting for businesses to get users to simply message them.</p>

<p>Why is messaging so hot right now? The same reason grocery delivery is making another run at it since Peapod imploded in 2000. Unlike 2000, we now have wireless mobile devices, affordable mobile data, interconnections between businesses(APIs), and relatively safe and secure mobile payment options.</p>

<p>At My A.I. Vendor, we believe messaging offers the opportunity to deliver many business services faster, and more conveniently than the web or apps. It is emerging as additional choice for consumers and businesses.Unless you can write code yourself, the average cost just to build an app is over $250,000. Most businesses cannot afford this. Not every business or consumer transaction needs an entire app. As new app-like services emerge on messaging platforms, you will see more and more commerce move to this format. It’s faster and easier for the customer, and lower cost for the business to implement.</p>
